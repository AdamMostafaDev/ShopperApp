# Search Feature Implementation Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of the universal search and product capture feature for UniShopper, allowing users to shop from Amazon directly and request products from any other store worldwide.

## Phase 0: Catch All Search Algorithm - Completed Tasks

### ‚úÖ Task 1.1: Universal Scraper API Implementation
**Status: Completed**

**Implementation Details:**
- Created `scrapeUniversalWithScraperAPI()` function in `/src/app/api/capture-product/route.ts`
- Integrated ScraperAPI for dynamic content rendering with fallback HTML scraper
- Supports automatic detection and extraction from non-partner websites

**Key Features:**
- Dynamic title extraction using multiple selectors (h1, meta tags, structured data)
- Multi-source price detection (CSS selectors, OpenGraph, JSON-LD)
- Smart image extraction with URL normalization
- Automatic store name detection from URLs
- Currency detection and BDT conversion
- Fallback mechanisms for missing data

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/app/api/capture-product/route.ts` - Added universal scraping functions
- Updated `ScrapedProduct` interface to include `store: 'other'` and `storeName` field

### ‚úÖ Task 1.2: HTML Fallback Scraper
**Status: Completed**

**Implementation Details:**
- Created `scrapeUniversalFallback()` function as secondary scraping method
- Uses axios with realistic browser headers
- Prioritizes OpenGraph and Twitter meta tags for reliability

**Fallback Strategy:**
1. Primary: ScraperAPI with JavaScript rendering
2. Secondary: Direct HTML scraping with cheerio
3. Final: Graceful degradation with partial data

### ‚úÖ Task 1.3: UI Updates for Partnership Integration
**Status: Completed**

**Implementation Details:**
- Updated hero section messaging to clarify Amazon as primary partner
- Added dynamic placeholder rotation showing various store names
- Modified unsupported link messaging to manual entry approach

**UI Changes:**
- **Typing Animation Placeholders:** Smooth typing animation with static prefix "Paste Product URL to:" followed by rotating product examples
- **Product Examples:** Specific product + store combinations like "Buy iPhone 15 Pro at Apple", "Get MacBook Air at Best Buy"
- **Partnership Badges:**
  - ‚úì Amazon - Auto (green badge)
  - üìù Others - Manual Entry (orange badge)
- **Manual Entry Flow:** Non-Amazon URLs show manual processing message with 24-hour timeline
- **Enhanced UX:** Removed fade transitions in favor of realistic typing animation (100ms per character typing, 50ms per character deleting)

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/app/(main)/page.tsx` - Hero section, typing animation, messaging
- `/src/app/globals.css` - Added typing animation CSS

### ‚úÖ Task 1.4: Enhanced Typing Animation (UI/UX Improvement)
**Status: Completed**

**Implementation Details:**
- Replaced fade-in/fade-out placeholder transitions with realistic typing animation
- Added static prefix "Paste Product URL to:" with dynamic product examples
- Implemented async/await based animation system for smooth character-by-character typing

**Animation Specifications:**
- **Typing Speed:** 100ms per character (realistic typing pace)
- **Deleting Speed:** 50ms per character (faster than typing)
- **Pause Duration:** 2 seconds between complete text and deletion start
- **Animation Loop:** Continuous cycle through 10 product examples

**Product Examples:**
```
Paste Product URL to: Buy iPhone 15 Pro at Apple
Paste Product URL to: Get MacBook Air at Best Buy
Paste Product URL to: Shop Nike Air Max at Nike
Paste Product URL to: Find Samsung TV at Target
Paste Product URL to: Buy AirPods Pro at Amazon
... and 5 more rotating examples
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- Used async/await pattern to eliminate useEffect dependency issues
- Implemented Promise-based delays for precise timing control
- Added cleanup logic to prevent animation conflicts

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/app/(main)/page.tsx` - Typing animation logic, placeholder management
- `/src/app/globals.css` - CSS keyframes for cursor effects (legacy, not currently used)

## Technical Architecture

### API Structure
```
/api/capture-product/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ detectStore() - Identifies Amazon/Walmart/eBay
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scrapeAmazonWithScraperAPI() - Amazon-specific scraping
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scrapeUniversalWithScraperAPI() - Universal scraping for other sites
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scrapeUniversalFallback() - HTML fallback scraper
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ POST handler - Main routing logic
```

### Scraping Strategy
```
URL Input
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Amazon/Walmart/eBay ‚Üí Specific scrapers
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Other stores ‚Üí Universal scraper
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ScraperAPI (primary)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ HTML fallback (secondary)
```

### Data Extraction Methods
1. **CSS Selectors:** Standard e-commerce patterns

### ‚úÖ Task 1.9: Nike URL Support Fix
**Status: Completed**

**Implementation Details:**
- Fixed frontend URL blocking issue that was preventing Nike URLs from reaching the backend API
- Updated `captureProductFromUrl()` function to allow non-partner stores (like Nike) to proceed to universal scraper
- Configured Next.js image domains to support Nike's static image CDN

**Problem Identified:**
- Backend API already had full Nike support through universal scraper and store logo mappings
- Frontend `product-capture.ts` was incorrectly blocking Nike URLs before they reached the backend
- Next.js image configuration was missing Nike's image domain (`static.nike.com`)

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Frontend Fix:** Modified URL detection logic to allow Amazon and non-partner stores, only restricting Walmart/eBay (not fully implemented)
- **Image Configuration:** Added comprehensive `remotePatterns` for Nike, Amazon, Walmart, eBay, and wildcard for other scraped images
- **Universal Support:** Nike URLs now properly flow through the universal scraper with store logo and full extraction capabilities

**Key Changes:**
- Updated `detectStore()` function logic to allow non-partner stores through to backend
- Added Nike-specific image domain support in `next.config.ts`
- Removed Amazon-only restriction that was blocking other supported stores
- Nike products now correctly show Nike logo and require approval (as intended for non-partner stores)

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/lib/product-capture.ts` - Updated URL detection and approval logic
- `/next.config.ts` - Added comprehensive image domain configuration

**User Experience:**
- Nike URLs now work seamlessly with product title, price, and image extraction
- Products show Nike logo and require user approval before cart addition
- Eliminates "This link is not supported" error for Nike and similar stores

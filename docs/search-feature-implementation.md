# Search Feature Implementation Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of the universal search and product capture feature for UniShopper, allowing users to shop from Amazon directly and request products from any other store worldwide.

## Phase 0: Catch All Search Algorithm - Completed Tasks

### ‚úÖ Task 1.1: Universal Scraper API Implementation
**Status: Completed**

**Implementation Details:**
- Created `scrapeUniversalWithScraperAPI()` function in `/src/app/api/capture-product/route.ts`
- Integrated ScraperAPI for dynamic content rendering with fallback HTML scraper
- Supports automatic detection and extraction from non-partner websites

**Key Features:**
- Dynamic title extraction using multiple selectors (h1, meta tags, structured data)
- Multi-source price detection (CSS selectors, OpenGraph, JSON-LD)
- Smart image extraction with URL normalization
- Automatic store name detection from URLs
- Currency detection and BDT conversion
- Fallback mechanisms for missing data

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/app/api/capture-product/route.ts` - Added universal scraping functions
- Updated `ScrapedProduct` interface to include `store: 'other'` and `storeName` field

### ‚úÖ Task 1.2: HTML Fallback Scraper
**Status: Completed**

**Implementation Details:**
- Created `scrapeUniversalFallback()` function as secondary scraping method
- Uses axios with realistic browser headers
- Prioritizes OpenGraph and Twitter meta tags for reliability

**Fallback Strategy:**
1. Primary: ScraperAPI with JavaScript rendering
2. Secondary: Direct HTML scraping with cheerio
3. Final: Graceful degradation with partial data

### ‚úÖ Task 1.3: UI Updates for Partnership Integration
**Status: Completed**

**Implementation Details:**
- Updated hero section messaging to clarify Amazon as primary partner
- Added dynamic placeholder rotation showing various store names
- Modified unsupported link messaging to manual entry approach

**UI Changes:**
- **Typing Animation Placeholders:** Smooth typing animation with static prefix "Paste Product URL to:" followed by rotating product examples
- **Product Examples:** Specific product + store combinations like "Buy iPhone 15 Pro at Apple", "Get MacBook Air at Best Buy"
- **Partnership Badges:**
  - ‚úì Amazon - Auto (green badge)
  - üìù Others - Manual Entry (orange badge)
- **Manual Entry Flow:** Non-Amazon URLs show manual processing message with 24-hour timeline
- **Enhanced UX:** Removed fade transitions in favor of realistic typing animation (100ms per character typing, 50ms per character deleting)

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/app/(main)/page.tsx` - Hero section, typing animation, messaging
- `/src/app/globals.css` - Added typing animation CSS

### ‚úÖ Task 1.4: Enhanced Typing Animation (UI/UX Improvement)
**Status: Completed**

**Implementation Details:**
- Replaced fade-in/fade-out placeholder transitions with realistic typing animation
- Added static prefix "Paste Product URL to:" with dynamic product examples
- Implemented async/await based animation system for smooth character-by-character typing

**Animation Specifications:**
- **Typing Speed:** 100ms per character (realistic typing pace)
- **Deleting Speed:** 50ms per character (faster than typing)
- **Pause Duration:** 2 seconds between complete text and deletion start
- **Animation Loop:** Continuous cycle through 10 product examples

**Product Examples:**
```
Paste Product URL to: Buy iPhone 15 Pro at Apple
Paste Product URL to: Get MacBook Air at Best Buy
Paste Product URL to: Shop Nike Air Max at Nike
Paste Product URL to: Find Samsung TV at Target
Paste Product URL to: Buy AirPods Pro at Amazon
... and 5 more rotating examples
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- Used async/await pattern to eliminate useEffect dependency issues
- Implemented Promise-based delays for precise timing control
- Added cleanup logic to prevent animation conflicts

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/app/(main)/page.tsx` - Typing animation logic, placeholder management
- `/src/app/globals.css` - CSS keyframes for cursor effects (legacy, not currently used)

## Technical Architecture

### API Structure
```
/api/capture-product/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ detectStore() - Identifies Amazon/Walmart/eBay
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scrapeAmazonWithScraperAPI() - Amazon-specific scraping
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scrapeUniversalWithScraperAPI() - Universal scraping for other sites
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scrapeUniversalFallback() - HTML fallback scraper
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ POST handler - Main routing logic
```

### Scraping Strategy
```
URL Input
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Amazon/Walmart/eBay ‚Üí Specific scrapers
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Other stores ‚Üí Universal scraper
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ScraperAPI (primary)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ HTML fallback (secondary)
```

### Data Extraction Methods
1. **CSS Selectors:** Standard e-commerce patterns
2. **Meta Tags:** OpenGraph, Twitter cards, product schemas
3. **JSON-LD:** Structured data for pricing and product info
4. **URL Parsing:** Store name extraction from domain

## Current Capabilities

### ‚úÖ Fully Supported (Automated)
- **Amazon:** Complete integration with pricing, images, reviews, features
- **Universal Sites:** Basic product info (title, image, price) from any website

### üîÑ Manual Processing
- **Non-Amazon Sites:** Manual team entry within 24 hours
- **Special Requests:** Custom product sourcing through contact form

## Testing Results

### Successful Tests
- ‚úÖ Best Buy: Product title and image extraction
- ‚úÖ Newegg: Product title and image extraction
- ‚úÖ Amazon: Full feature set maintained

### Known Limitations
- Price extraction varies by site structure
- Some sites with heavy JavaScript may need ScraperAPI premium features
- Manual review needed for complex product configurations

## Next Phase Tasks (Pending)

### üîÑ Task 1.4: URL-Based Store Name Parsing
- Implement robust store name extraction from URLs
- Fallback to page title parsing
- Default to "Pending Product Details" when unavailable

### üîÑ Task 1.5: Advanced Image Fallback System
- OpenGraph image extraction (partially implemented)
- Store logo database creation
- Generic product image fallback

### üîÑ Task 1.6: Price Fallback Mechanisms
- Enhanced price detection algorithms
- Currency symbol recognition improvements
- Price validation and error handling

### üîÑ Task 1.7: Cart Approval Flow
- User approval system for non-partner products

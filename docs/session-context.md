# Session Context Management

## How This Works
This file maintains context across Claude Code sessions to prevent losing important information when conversations get long or need to be restarted.

## Current Session Status
**Date**: 2025-09-17
**Branch**: feature/organic-search-flow
**Server**: Running on localhost:3006 (fresh restart, cleared .next cache)

## Recently Completed Work

### âœ… Fixed à§³NaN Pricing Issue (COMPLETED)
**Problem**: Individual order items showing "à§³NaN" while order totals showed correct amounts
**Root Cause**: Cart items stored as `{ product: { price: 123 }, quantity: 2 }` but display logic expected `{ price: 123, quantity: 2 }`
**Solution**: Added transformation in `src/app/api/create-payment-intent/route.ts:150-156`
**Status**: Fixed, tested and working

### âœ… Implemented Individual Item Pricing System (COMPLETED)
**Problem**: Admin could only edit total product cost, which didn't make sense for multi-item orders
**Solution**: Complete individual item pricing system
**Key Changes**:
- **Admin UI**: Individual item price editors instead of bulk total editing
- **Database**: Uses `finalItems` JSON field to store individual updated prices
- **Auto-calculation**: Product cost auto-calculates from sum of (item price Ã— quantity)
- **API Updates**: Both admin and customer order APIs now return `finalItems`
- **Display Logic**: Updated to use individual pricing from `finalItems`

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/(admin)/admin/dashboard/orders/page.tsx` - Individual item editing UI
- `src/app/api/admin/orders/[id]/update-pricing/route.ts` - Backend API for finalItems
- `src/app/api/admin/orders/route.ts` - Added finalItems to response
- `src/app/api/orders/[id]/route.ts` - Added finalItems to customer API
- `src/lib/display-utils.ts` - Updated to calculate from finalItems
- `src/app/(main)/orders/[id]/page.tsx` - Added finalItems interface

**Status**: Fully implemented and tested - admin can edit individual item prices, totals auto-calculate, customer sees updated prices

### âœ… Added Context Management System (COMPLETED)
**Problem**: Risk of losing important work context between sessions
**Solution**: Documentation-based context persistence system
**Files Added**:
- `docs/session-context.md` - Main context file
- `docs/context-management-guide.md` - Usage instructions
**Status**: Complete

### âœ… Admin Dashboard Shipping & Fees UI Improvements (COMPLETED - 2025-09-16)
**Problem**: Shipping & fees section in admin orders page had poor alignment and confusing UX
**Solution**: Complete redesign of shipping & fees editing interface
**Key Improvements**:
- **Collapsible dropdown**: Main shipping total with expandable breakdown (> arrow rotates to âŒ„)
- **Dual editing modes**: Direct total editing OR detailed breakdown (shipping cost + additional fees)
- **Perfect alignment**: All input fields and values properly flush-aligned left/right
- **Clean UI**: Removed number input spinners from all price fields
- **Better typography**: Improved "Fee Description" text size and contrast
- **Smart defaults**: Direct total editing puts value into shipping cost, clears additional fees
- **Intuitive UX**: 90% of cases can edit total directly, 10% can use breakdown for complex orders
- **Customer transparency**: Customer order page shows shipping breakdown when additional fees exist (e.g., "Shipping Cost: à§³3,000" + "Electronics handling: à§³2,000")

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/(admin)/admin/dashboard/orders/page.tsx` - Complete shipping & fees UI redesign
- `src/app/(main)/orders/[id]/page.tsx` - Added shipping breakdown display for customers

**Status**: Fully implemented - clean, professional admin interface with perfect alignment and intuitive editing workflows. Customer order page now shows shipping breakdown when additional fees are present.

### âœ… Collapsible Shipping Breakdown - Customer Orders Page (COMPLETED - 2025-09-17)
**Problem**: User wanted collapsible shipping fees breakdown on customer orders page similar to previous collapsible features
**Solution**: Implemented collapsible shipping section showing fee descriptions and breakdown
**Key Features**:
- **Collapsible shipping section**: Shows "Shipping & Fees: à§³X,XXX" with clickable chevron icon by default
- **Expanded breakdown**: When clicked, shows individual shipping cost + additional fees + fee description
- **Conditional display**: Fee description only shows when additional fees exist
- **Proper styling**: Indented breakdown with border to show hierarchy
- **React state management**: Uses `useState` for controlling collapse state
- **Heroicons integration**: ChevronDownIcon with rotation animation

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/(main)/orders/[id]/page.tsx` - Added collapsible shipping breakdown functionality
- `src/lib/display-utils.ts` - Updated `getDisplayAmounts` to include shipping breakdown fields

**Status**: Fully implemented and working on customer orders page at `http://localhost:3003/orders/[id]`

### âœ… Email Template Updates - Payment Confirmation (COMPLETED - 2025-09-17)
**Problem**: Payment confirmation email template needed shipping breakdown support and UX improvements
**Solution**: Updated email template for better professional appearance and shipping breakdown display
**Key Changes**:
- **Shipping breakdown display**: Always shows "Shipping Cost" + "Additional Fees" + "Fee Description" rows instead of single shipping line
- **Removed "What happens next?" section**: Eliminated confusing blue info box
- **Updated CTA button**: Changed from green "âœ“ Confirm Order" to blue "Confirm Payment" (matching order confirmation style)
- **Removed refund button**: Since payment hasn't been charged yet, refund option is inappropriate
- **Improved pricing notice**: Combined and simplified text with package emoji (ðŸ“¦)
- **Professional styling**: Fee description in right column with proper alignment

**Files Modified**:
- `email-html-templates/payment-confirmation.html` - Complete redesign for shipping breakdown and professional appearance

**Variables Required in Backend**:
- `event.final_shipping_only_bdt` - Individual shipping cost
- `event.final_additional_fees_bdt` - Additional fees amount
- `event.fee_description` - Fee description text

**Status**: Template updated and ready for backend integration

### âœ… Payment Confirmation Email System Implementation (COMPLETED - 2025-09-17)
**Problem**: Admin needed ability to send payment confirmation emails after calculating final pricing
**Solution**: Complete email sending system with Klaviyo integration
**Key Components**:
- **New Klaviyo Function**: `sendPaymentConfirmationEmail()` in `src/lib/klaviyo.ts`
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/admin/orders/[id]/send-confirmation-email` route
- **Admin UI**: "Send Confirmation Email" button with loading states in admin dashboard
- **Email Template**: Fixed variable names to match data structure
- **Error Handling**: Proper loading states and error feedback

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `src/lib/klaviyo.ts` - Added new sendPaymentConfirmationEmail function
- `src/app/api/admin/orders/[id]/send-confirmation-email/route.ts` - New API endpoint
- `src/app/(admin)/admin/dashboard/orders/page.tsx` - Added email button functionality
- `email-html-templates/payment-confirmation.html` - Fixed template variables and à§³ symbol formatting

**Key Data Mapping**:
- Template uses: `event.product_cost_bdt`, `event.service_charge_bdt`, `event.tax_bdt`, `event.total_amount_bdt`
- All pricing fields display with à§³ symbol formatting
- Shipping breakdown with additional fees support
- Customer confidence messaging: "You're seeing the most up-to-date prices"

**Status**: Fully working - API tested successfully, emails sending through Klaviyo, template variables properly populated
